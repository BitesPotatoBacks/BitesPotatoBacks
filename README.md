### Bio
I am a young tech enthusiast who holds interests in **CPU architecture, electrical engineering, operating system design, computer graphics, 3D modeling, software development,** and about a hundred other loosely related topics.

I spend most of my time working on small and unique open source projects, but have recently been getting more into hardware engineering and higher levels of software development. My preferred programming languages are C-based, but I make use of Shell and Swift when they seem more practical.

### News
I've recently tested out the Apple Developer experience with a simple WatchOS app called **Coin Fliporator**! I'm actually pretty satisifed with it and it's gotten a bit more attention than I expected. You can check it out over [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coin-fliporator/id1611054060) if you'd like.
