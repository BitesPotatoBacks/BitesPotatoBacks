# Greetings and Salutations

I am a young software developer, graphic designer, digital artist, tech geek, and hardcore Apple fan who is currently working on way too many projects revolving around C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, and Shell. Although web development is not my strongest focus, I often find myself messing around with Javascript, HTML, and CSS aswell.

If I'm not coding, I'm probably ranting about aluminum chasis, translucency, Lam√© curves, IOKit, or how annoying it is trying to read assembly language.
