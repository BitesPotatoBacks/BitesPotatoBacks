## Greetings and Salutations

I am a young software developer, designer, tech enthusiast, and hardcore Apple fan. I have decent experience with web development (HTML, JS, CSS) but I tend to focus on more low/medium level languages (C, C++, Objective-C, Assembley). I'm pretty obsessed with hardware monitoring and CPUs, so you'll see a lot of that kind of stuff here. I'm also a design nut.

**Biggest accomplishment so far:** Figuring out how to get the CPUs current frequency, per core and per cluster, on Intel and Apple Silicon. You can see the project [here](https://github.com/BitesPotatoBacks/osx-cpufreq).
