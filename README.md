### Bio
I am a young tech enthusiast who holds interests in **CPU architecture, electrical engineering, operating system design, computer graphics, 3D modeling, software development,** and about a thousand other loosely related topics. I spend most of my time endlessly researching or working on my many, many projects.

### News
I've recently tested out the Apple Developer experience with a simple WatchOS app called **Coin Fliporator**! I'm actually pretty satisifed with it. You can check it out over [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coin-fliporator/id1611054060) if you'd like.
