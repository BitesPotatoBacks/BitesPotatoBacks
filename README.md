### About Me
**Bio:** I am a young software developer and tech enthusiast analyzing the wonders of Apple Silicon and developing useful CPU performance monitoring tools for Macs, amongst other things. I enjoy drawing, gaming, reading comics, and 3D modeling in my spare time.

**Coding Expertise:** I work primarily with Objective-C, but also have some experience with Javascript, Shell, and Assembly. I despise Swift.

**News:** I recently tested out the Apple App Store experience with a simple WatchOS app called Coin Fliporator. You can check it out [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coin-fliporator/id1611054060) if you'd like.
