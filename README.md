### About Me

**Bio:** I am a young software developer and graphic designer analyzing aspects of CPU performance, power, and architecture; developing useful metric retrieval command line tools related to that research, or working on whatever other unrelated project tickles my fancy. I enjoy drawing, gaming, reading comics, and 3D modeling in my spare time.

**Coding Expertise:** I work primarily with C based languages, but I also have some experience with Javascript, Shell, and Assembly. I despise Swift.

**News:** I recently tested out the Apple Developer experience with a simple WatchOS app called Coin Fliporator. It aims to be the best coin flipping app available for  WatchOS. You can check it out [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coin-fliporator/id1611054060) if you'd like.
