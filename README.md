### Howdy ðŸ‘‹
I'm a young tech enthusiast developing apps for the Apple App Store, creating hardware monitoring projects for MacOS, and 3D modeling in my spare time because Iâ€™ve got nothing better to do.

When it comes to programming, I tend to focus on lower level languages (such as C, C++, Objective-C, Assembley), but I also have decent experience with web development (HTML, JS, CSS). I donâ€™t like Swift, but It makes my life easier. Sometimes.
