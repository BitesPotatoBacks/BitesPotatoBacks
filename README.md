# Greetings and Salutations

I am a young software developer, designer, tech enthusiast, and Apple sheep who is actively making cool stuff with C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, and Shell. Every now and then, I'll make something cool with Javascript, HTML, and CSS as well.

Currently, I am learning Assembly Language and starting development on an operating system. In my spare time, I can be found ranting about translucency, Lam√© curves, ChromeOS, or IOKit.
