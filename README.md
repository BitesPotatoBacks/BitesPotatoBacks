### I enjoy writing Shell scripts, and I am currently working on way too many ElectronJS and SwiftUI app. I have some experience with Python, C#, and an extremely small amount of Objective-C and C++, but I usually don't touch those languages.

If I'm not coding, I'm graphic designing. If I'm not graphic designing, I'm probably ranting about computers. Or graphic design.
