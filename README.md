# Greetings and Salutations

I am a young software developer, graphic designer, digital artist, tech geek, and hardcore Apple fan who is currently working on way too many projects revolving around C, C++, Objective-C (My favorite programming language), Swift, and Shell. I have strong experience with _Javascript, HTML,_ _CSS_, and often find myself poking around in the APIs of _ElectronJS_. 

If I'm not coding, I'm probably ranting about aluminum chasis, translucency, Lam√© curves, or how annoying it is trying to read assembly language.
