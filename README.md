# :apple: Greetings from Apple Sheep land :apple:

I am a young software developer, graphic designer, digital artist, and tech geek who is currently working on way too many projects revolving around _Swift_ and _SwiftUI_ (with the occasional hint of _Objective-C_).

I have extensive experience with _Javascript, HTML,_ and _CSS_. Every now and then I like to play around with _ElectronJS_ and it's APIs (I actively find issues involving translucency and vibrancy, probably because I'm in love with frosted glass). I also enjoy making minimal _Shell_ scripts and looking at CPU benchmarks for no reason.

I am also a hardcore Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch user who actively takes part in ranting about aluminum chasis, rounded rectangles, and how annoying it is trying to read Mach-O binaries.
