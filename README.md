## Hello, World

I am a young tech enthusiast developing apps for the Apple App Store, creating CPU related projects for MacOS, and 3D modeling in my spare time because I’ve got nothing better to do.

When it comes to programming, I tend to focus on more low/medium level languages (C, C++, Objective-C, Assembley), but I also have decent experience with web development (HTML, JS, CSS). I don’t like Swift, but It makes my life easier. Sometimes.
