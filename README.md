### About Me

Young tech enthusiast and hardcore Apple fan pouring my life essence into the things that most interest me. Currently creating CPU power monitoring tools for MacOS and developing random apps for the App Store. Drawing, 3D modeling, and Gaming in my spare time.

Check out my very first WatchOS app, [**Coin Fliporator**](https://apps.apple.com/app/coin-fliporator/id1611054060), on the App Store. Version **1.1** just released 
 with bug fixes, 4 new coins, and support for 40 new languages.

### Coding Expertise
Primarily C, C++, Objective-C. Decent experience with Javascript, Shell, and Assembely. I hate Swift but it makes life easier (sometimes).
