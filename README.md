# :apple: Greetings from Apple Sheep land :apple:

I am a young software developer, graphic designer, digital artist, and tech geek who is currently working on way too many projects revolving around _Swift, Objective-C_, and _Shell_.

Along with that, I have extensive experience with _Javascript, HTML,_ _CSS_, and often find myself poking around in the APIs of _ElectronJS_. 

I am also a hardcore Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch user who actively takes part in ranting about aluminum chasis, rounded rectangles, translucency, and how annoying it is trying to read GNU assembly.
