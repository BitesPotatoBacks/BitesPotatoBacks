### This here is my README.
**Bio:**
Just a dude who's very interested in CPU architecture and design; developing useful metric retrieval command line tools related to that interest, or working on whatever other unrelated project tickles my fancy. I work primarily with C based languages, and I despise Swift.

**News:**
 I recently tested out the Apple Developer experience with a simple WatchOS app called Coin Fliporator. It aims to be the best coin flipping app available for  WatchOS. You can check it out [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coin-fliporator/id1611054060) if you'd like.
