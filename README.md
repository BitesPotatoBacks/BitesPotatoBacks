# Greetings and Salutations

I am a young software developer, designer, and tech enthusiast, spending my time making mildly interesting things with C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, and Shell (with an occasional hint of Javascript, HTML, and CSS as well).

In my spare time, I can be found drooling over Apple products and ranting about random stuff.

If you want to see a list of everything I've created, visit my [actively updated website](https://bitespotatobacks.github.io).
