## Some Stuff About Me :monocle_face:
Some stuff that describes me:
- Tech Nerd
- Apple Sheep
- Hardcore Mac User
- Insane Design Nut
- Cat Lover
- Devourer of Shawarma

### I enjoy writing Shell scripts, and I am currently working on a few too many ElectronJS and SwiftUI projects... I have some experience with Python, a little bit with C#, and an extremely small amount with Obj-C and C++...
...And when I _say_ 'extremely small', I _mean_ 'extremely small'. I'm better at reading Obj-C and C++ than I am at writing it.

If I'm not coding, I'm either graphic designing, or ranting about graphic design. Or ranting about Apple.
