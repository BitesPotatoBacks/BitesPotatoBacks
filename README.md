## Greetings and Salutations

I am a young software developer, designer, tech enthusiast, and hardcore Apple product user.

I spend my time making mildly interesting things with C, C++, Objective-C, Swift, and Shell (with an occasional hint of Javascript, HTML, and CSS as well).

If I'm not coding, I'm probably ranting or watching Linus Tech Tips.

If you want to see a clean list of all my programming projects, visit my [actively updated website](https://bitespotatobacks.github.io).

If you would like to support me, you can donate to my [Cash App](https://cash.app/$bitespotatobacks)
