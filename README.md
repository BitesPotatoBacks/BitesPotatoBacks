### Howdy ðŸ‘‹
I'm a young tech enthusiast developing apps for the App Store, creating hardware monitoring projects for MacOS, deeply analyzing the wonders of CPU power management, and 3D modeling in my spare time because Iâ€™ve got nothing better to do. I code primarily in C, C++, and Objective-C, but I'll occasionly mess around with Shell and Assembley, too. I donâ€™t like Swift, but it makes my life easier. Sometimes.
